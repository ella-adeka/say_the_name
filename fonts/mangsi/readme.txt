Mangsi in Javanese means ink. We want to create a modern display typeface with an inked-like feel by combining clean modern serif strokes, brush strokes and the curved line made by the ink tank.

Mangsi is a modern inked display typeface that unites the beauty of the old lines with the clean modern lines. A simple, yet distinctive, elegant font that can be applied to many areas of design. Coming with 170+ stunning and super easy to use alternates and ligatures.

This version is a Personal to Use Only. If you wish to use it for commercial use, you need to purchase a license.
